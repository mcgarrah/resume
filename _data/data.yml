          **Unified Portfolio Accounting (UPA)**

          UPA is a portfolio accounting platform using bleeding-edge cloud-native technologies for a highly scalable service to maintain, balance, adjust, and validate financial data from custodian platforms and trusted connections to existing platforms like UMP
          and Tamarac along with our clients. Some resources of the system include EKS with integrations for vEMR
          (Hadoop), Airflow (MWAA) and custom workflows. This system utilizes containerized microservices
          managed on a service-mesh deployed from managed CICD pipelines with IaC managed infrastructure.

          **Small and Medium Business Portal (SMB Portal)**

          SMB Portal provides a platform to
          empower businesses to make important decisions more easily and take actions based on data. The
          integrated portal includes the apps that most SMBs use to run their businesses and provides greater
          opportunity for growth and partnership between SMBs and banks. The software was implemented with
          cloud-native containerized microservices which was migrated to AWS managed cloud services as part of a
          migration. IaC (Infrastructure as Code) and conversion from on-premise and alternate cloud vendors was a major
          hurdle to implementation and bringing the product to a managed state.

          **Data Science Initiatives (DSI)**

          Multiple internal projects with data engineering and management using
          a variety of methods including serverless machine learning (Lambda/Step) development and SageMaker
          with container deployment mechanisms. These projects include finding the data in the enterprise and
          providing repeatable data feeds which are a considerable challenge. Providing cloud compute platforms for
          data scientists to do evaluations of the data and promoting as production models continues to be an
          interesting and difficult process that we are continuously refining.

          **Data Marketplace** 

          External vendor web-application with internal compute and storage for a
          data management platform in the financial services space. Integration with the internal system via managed
          processes and managing security concerns were the primary concerns and issues with implementation.

          Building a data science platform incorporating a data‐warehouse, data‐lake and data‐execution environment 
          using containerized cloud-first technologies (AWS & Kubernetes) to support our mission of data driven 
          decision to provide for a value‐based healthcare approach. A public example includes the media example below:
            - <a href="https://www.bluecrossnc.com/medicare-guided-selling-landing-page" target="_blank">Medicare Guided Selling</a>
        details: |
          **Cloud-First Platform (AWS)**

          Built a complete multi-account AWS platform managed via
          CloudFormation (CF) stacks from the ground up. All aspects of the platform from VPC to IAM/Policy
          moving towards the higher-level components like shared RDS clusters, EKS clusters, EMR and associated
          dependent services like S3, ACM PCA, EFS with CSI integration to EKS, Route53 integration with
          enterprise Infoblox and other services as necessary were all managed via CF stacks. This had overhead but
          allowed for a highly consistent and managed cross-account environment working together. This
          implementation included writing Lambda functions and CF Custom Resources for several services when
          CF did not offer a mechanism to manage a service completely.

          **Containerized Development (Kubernetes)**

          Implemented local standardized Kubernetes
          development with Docker for Windows/Mac and managed AWS EKS Kubernetes cluster per AWS
          account. Local development initially used docker-compose for deployments to Kubernetes in Docker
          (KinD) with a migration to Helm3 Charts. The EKS deployments were managed with a shared
          cross-account CICD Pipeline giving developers full control over build and deployments. Spot-instance CPU
          & GPU enabled EC2 worker nodes with zero-scaled nodes for GPU to reduce cost allowed for a
          cost-effective execution platform. The EKS managed Kubernetes and associated AWS resources
          (EFS/Route53/ACM/VPC/etc) were all managed via CloudFormation stacks (or scripted configuration
          changes) with synchronized infrastructure deployment environments for development stages. Some of the
          major inclusions for the K8S clusters were helm chart managed External-DNS, Nginx-Ingress with NLB,
          Cluster Autoscaler, Nvidia device plugin, Prometheus with resource metrics, KubeWatch and EFS CSI
          drivers. K8S Service Account (KSA) permissions via AWS IAM Role/Policy at the container level rather
          than node level offered additional security for managed access to AWS resources. Extensions using AWS
          Fargate container execution are enabled in a non-HIPAA environment while working out compliance
          requirements.

          **Medicare Guided Selling Tool (MGS)**

          The Plan Finder Tool offers an easy way for members to use
          their claims data to recommend a plan that best fits their needs. This is for members who are moving from
          a Blue Cross NC commercial plan to a Blue Cross NC Medicare plan. The public accessible interface for
          the recommendation engine can be found at [MGS Landing](https://www.bluecrossnc.com/medicare-guided-selling-landing-page).
          My involvement was to implement
          the initial recommendation system in May 2019 before our AWS platform was ready for general use. I
          quickly created a fully integrated and managed Serverless Framework (SLS) implementation using an AWS
          API-Gateway backed with Lambda functions written in Python3 providing a REST API for WebUI
          developers which pulled content from a DAX/DynamoDB datastore populated by a custom built
          containerized event-driven ETL process also written in Python 3.6. This implementation has been live on
          the above public URL since June 2019 and will be decommissioned 3Q2021 in favor of the new CICD
          Pipeline and ETL processes implemented in 2Q2020. I have been heavily involved in transitioning the
          above and building out the cross-account CICD Pipeline (Jenkins) and data engineering tooling (ETL) to
          support broader development and data engineering practices across the company. As a first-stage developer
          of a public accessed service, I was in a unique position both as an infrastructure implementer and consumer
          of both the development and data engineering services the platform team provided to the enterprise.

          **Drug Lookup and Calculation (DLC)**

          The DLC project was an investigation into a standard
          enterprise-wide REST API that would allow for fast drug lookups via sub-strings for ease of search in a
          web-ui, validation of drug information with parameters, and cost calculations when member details were
          available to map against plan benefits. The pilot REST API was implemented rapidly as part of the MGST
          for 2Q2021 deliverables and then made available across the enterprise as the value was broadly recognized.

          **CarePath (Machine Learning) Models**

          CarePath is a software framework developed by Blue
          Cross NC that acts as a deep learning model factory. It constructs state-of-the-art deep neural networks
          which learn and then recognize the patterns in sequences of claims which eventually lead to particular
          health events. This enables Blue Cross to accurately identify members at risk for a wide range of
          preventable events.

          We used this in-house general framework to build specific health related models to identify member level
          risks and possible health impact to focus our care management programs on those members at greatest risk
          and improve their health outcomes. Production examples of this include:
          * Complex Case Management (CCM) models for predicting both potential hospital initial admissions
          and separate readmissions after care using claims and other historical data to target members at
          risk with the goal of improving health outcomes. These two models have had a measurable impact
          on member health.
          * Hospital to Home (H2H) model to identify members at high risk for readmission who need
          support transitioning from inpatient care to their homes.
          * Additional models for Cardiovascular disease, Diabetes

          The CCM model was recognized with an Excellence In Service Innovation Award from the International
          Society of Service Innovation Professionals (ISSIP) and the H2H model with an [Innovator Award from
          Healthcare Innovation](https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/analytics-ai/predictive-analytics/article/21230131/innovator-awards-second-place-winning-team-blue-cross-blue-shield-of-north-carolina).

          My role was to validate the framework and models along with assisting in making the code-base production
          ready. I was also the primary implementer for creating an enterprise production capable platform for the
          final product. The platform implementation was initially on local laptops and later an AWS EC2 instance.
          I performed code reviews and changes for the framework source code, individual model data-prep and
          code, enterprise processes and data management as we moved out of the internal POC. I rewrote sections
          of the framework and model code to allow migration to scalable cost-effective containerized managed
          Kubernetes (K8S) deployment using our multi-stage secure cloud-native development platform that
          provided for a fully self-managed developer experience via a cross-account CICD Pipeline. This allowed for
          fast cycle times for the development. Further improvements I added included zero-scaled K8S GPU nodes
          instantiated via resource taint/toleration, scalable and highly available scoring access for the daily public
          model releases and secure access to managed internal only datastores for the model generation.

          **Cloud Services and Architecture**

          Oversee the design and execution of the cloud computing strategy
          including the cloud adoptions plans, cloud application design, and
          cloud management and monitoring. Provide expertise in the
          definition, design, implementation, adoption and adherence to
          enterprise architecture strategies, processes and standards. This
          role at AKC is currently focused on expertise in the Amazon cloud
          technologies.

          Rebuild and redesign the primary www.akc.org website to use
          Amazon Web Services in a rapid migration from a hosted vendor
          environment. A lack of existing documentation, standards, and
          procedures for this rapid migration impeded earlier efforts at a
          seamless transition. No customer impact for the migration I led and
          completed in a break-neck six-week period. A similar exercise for
          a large consumer transaction website marketplace.akc.org was
          completed in a period of two weeks with a contracted partner
          assisting in the effort. Again, done with no customer impact for
          these transitions.

          Reduction in overall website costs from approximately $30,000
          USD per month to less than $5,000 USD. Plans for additional
          reduction in cost to bring total under $3500 per month. Improved
          uptime, reduced TTFB (time to first byte), and reduced variability
          of web page responses all contribute to a better user experience.
          Continued improvements for caching, database optimization and
          deep application monitoring continue to be implemented for
          improved user experience.

          End-to-end CI/CD implemented for the primary website with
          additional integration testing frameworks being provided to
          improve the developer effectiveness and increase the rate of
          deployments.

          Application Modernization from legacy ColdFusion, PERL, and
          Java applications to move to a MEAN development stack and
          utilize AWS for the new environments. Design and
          implementation of the new infrastructure proceeds. Varied
          solutions for the legacy migration include Amazon EMR, ELK log
          management, ElastiCache, CloudFront, Beanstalk and various other
          AWS services. Impediments include a monolithic Oracle database
          structure and legacy desktop applications accessing the same data
          in real-time.

          **Programmer**

          Build an Amazon EMR implementation for use by the Application
          Modernization effort. ELK log management for use by individual
          application monitoring and management.
          
          Evaluate website architecture and develop plans for implementing
          opcache with php-fpm to accelerate processing of dynamic PHP
          content. Redis and Memcache implementations are not optimized
          for short span session content.
          
          Rewrote sections of the PHP based Expression Engine 2.9.3
          (CMS) to be fully compliant with PHP 5.6 enabled with warning as
          errors. Reduced load times on scripts noticeably.
          
          Varnish Caching server implementation requires a re-write of the
          HTTP session and redirection rules. Current design allows for
          replay of session actions for invalid responses.
          
          Redirection/Rewrite Rule proliferation includes six locations for a
          rule to be enacted with the possibility of looping redirections.
          Building a separation of the rule's evaluation with logging into an
          ELK implementation to assist in understanding the scope of the
          challenge. Current implementation has over twenty-six thousand
          (26,000) rules.

          Designing a method for domain root flattening that does not

          **Architecture**

          Accountable for developing, maintaining and overseeing the
          execution of formalized technology, application, platform, and
          systems integration strategies. Conduct enterprise-wide analysis,
          collaboratively establish technology road maps, champion critical
          changes and negotiate statewide standards and policies in the form
          of Enterprise Architecture. Ensure the successful development and
          effective execution of IT strategies. Systematic management of
          enterprise IT standards, policies and strategies for a portfolio of
          technology platforms, products, and practices.

          As part of the evaluation during the Network Modernization
          program, clear issues with the existing security policy and state-wide
          architectural standards emerged. In cooperation with the State
          Risk Officer, we are releasing a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a
          rewrite of the security standards with an emphasis on modernized
          practices based on NIST and DoD standards.

          Plans for revisions of the state-wide architectural standards began
          with an outline of critical sections requiring position papers for
          new technologies. I began revisions of the firewall, hosting and n-
          tier architecture completing drafts.

          **Cloud Initiatives**

          Investigation of statewide data center Cloud usage with external
          and hybrid Microsoft Azure VM (compute) services. Also
          involved in work done with RedHat OpenShift (backed by AWS
          VMs) and a direct Amazon engagement.

          Ensure the successful development and effective execution of IT
          strategies. Manage enterprise IT standards, policies and strategies
          for a portfolio of technology platforms, products, and practices.
          Initial focus on converged technologies with focus on network
          modernization with software defined networks (SDN).

          SDI (software defined infrastructure) strategy for the state with the
          SDS (storage) SDN (network) VM (compute) and orchestration of
          the services.

          **Networking**

          Assist in developing and defining a program for the modernization
          of the State of North Carolina data center networks. Refined the
          existing understanding of network infrastructure by multiple
          stakeholders into a document outlining the known state of the data
          center networks. The current network is overly complex with many
          features that are static and resist rapid change or automation. The
          configuration of the individual network segments and network
          services lack in standardization which results in complex
          configurations prone to failures during change events.

          In response, lead a group in writing a Request for Information
          (RFI) to ask third parties to assist the State in understanding how to
          modernize our data center networks to embrace new concepts such
          as cloud, third party hosting, mobility of services and incorporate
          flexibility into the State network to allow for adding new methods
          of doing business.

          Implement in Python a knowledge-based AI agent using generic
          learners to find solutions to the Raven’s Progressive Matrices
          visual intelligence test. Applied machine learning from natural
          language processing (NLP) methods to the image recognition and
          pattern recognition in generic non-domain specific attribute based
          evaluations. Implementation involved both identification of shape
          matching and transformations of shapes between frames. Weighted
          models of attributes or feature values were used to determine
          features that impacted identification of important transforms.

          A simplified example of the proposition is to solve A is to B as C
          is to # from the figure below. Human cognition will quickly
          identify figure 5 as the solution with a 45° rotation of the shapes.
          An AI Agent requires identifying the mapping between shapes in
          A & B then the transforms performed on B to make them match A.

          *Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)*

          Document development processes and provide a detailed
          assessment to close gaps in policy before November 2007 IRS
          audit. Assessment implementation included the addition of manual
          and automated code reviews for web development. Defining
          coding best practices and coding standards improved code quality.
          Addition of web application vulnerability scanning improved PCI
          and IRS compliance.

          Actively promoted the removal of administrative and root access
          for all development staff. Removal was done to improve
          development processes and segment activities between groups.
          Maintaining the subset of access necessary to perform software
          installation in non-production and provide a standardized build
          environment improved software quality.

          Promoted the replacement of legacy Microsoft SourceSafe source
          control system with the open source Subversion and associated
          reporting and administrative tools. Implementation allows for the
          addition of technical writers, business users, development and
          testers access to documentation and software. Defect tracking and
          source code changes are linked and related.

          Security reviews and sign-off were integrated into each step of the
          DOR SDLC process from business requirements to the completed
          production release. Integration of security reviews and sign-off
          into each step increased compliance and decreased re-work costs
          from the prior methodology.

        link: https://github.com/mcgarrah/quicksight_demo
        tagline: >
          The goal of this repository is to automate as much as possible, from the varied AWS posts
          on Federated QuickSight integration, the manual steps in Terraform and convert the CloudFormation 
          to Terraform where possible. Also, updating the Python Lambda layers and code to more current 
          versions of libraries and runtimes is in scope as well.

        link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG_DpV4CFj61_ltukKYaYQNipEFOLMqBe
        tagline: >
          My academic partner and I automated identifying the sounds of a non-English language,
          found the temporal boundary markers or segmentations, and fully automated output of
          segmentation results in a linguistically useful format. My part was generalizing the 
          code to handle the language features and separate those into a configuration file. My 
          partner created the non-English language dictionaries. The heavy lift was building the 
          dictionaries for Swedish and Danish but he needed a platform to use them. I also built
          a website to present an interface.
